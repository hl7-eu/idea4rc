• Curative chemotherapy is chemotherapy administered with the goal of achieving a complete remission and preventing the recurrence of cancer. 
• Palliative chemotherapy refers to any chemotherapy administration that is not curative but administered simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy. It has been defined also as “…treatment in circumstances where the impact of intervention is insufficient to result in major survival advantage, but does affect improvement in terms of tumor‐related symptoms…”

• Neoadjuvant: treatment given as a first step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, which is usually surgery, is given. Examples of neoadjuvant therapy include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy. It is a type of induction therapy.
• Adjuvant: additional cancer treatment given after the primary treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back. Adjuvant therapy may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or biological therapy.
• Concomitant/concurrent: A treatment that is given at the same time as another (es. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy).
 
THIS INFO CAN BE DERIVED AT QUERY TIME

- Adjuvant chemotherapy is any chemo given after surgery in the hope that the chemo will kill off the remaining cancer cells. This is not a vocabulary issue. You have to create a cohort with chemo patient and a prior surgery recently. There is no difference between chemo and adjuvant chemo in terms of what drugs are used.
- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chemo given before surgery, with the idea that the chemo will shrink the cancer enough that it can be removed surgically. Against, still a normal chemo.
- Palliative chemotherapy is any chemo given to people without the hope of curing them. It’s just for prolonging life. Again, ordinary chemo."""
