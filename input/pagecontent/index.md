> governance, the sharing, and the re-use of health data for rare cancers.

### The IDEA4RC project

#### Overview 

**<span class="underline">IDEA4RC</span>** is a EU funded
Research and Innovation action aiming to study the scale-up and
implementation of an ecosystem for the re-use of health data
related to that portion of population affected by rare cancers.

Building on the principles of the European Data strategy, the Rare Cancer
Data Ecosystem concept proposed by IDEA4RC will unite available data sources
and equip them with strong data governance controls to lay down the basis
for an embryonic data spece for rare cancers. This because despite their
relevance, rare cancers in general get a few scientific consideration and
financial support. Carrying out clinical studies is difficult, because of
the small number of sample populations. Therefore, clinical evidence is
more difficult to build, clinical management is more complex, and shortage
of accesible cancer registries and data is a fundamental obstacle. These can
be overcome only through large collaborations exploiting networks
specializing in rare cancers, that pool knowledge and data together.

#### Objectives

The overall aim of IDEA4RC is to **leverage the digital
transformation of healthcare to improve people-centred survivorship care
by scaling up and implementing an intelligent ecosystem for improving the
sharing of health data for rare cancers.**

##### Preparation for Implementation

1.  **exploit the potential of EURACAN and other existing ERNs** for RC
    data sharing acrosso Europe for rare cancer "data economy" scenarios
    co-creation and valuation supported by sound data governance policies
    and a resilient and privacy preserving IT architecture. 

2.  **extend HL7 FHIR concepts to a distributed data sharing enviroment**
    and realize a set of AI-assisted tools ensuring interoperability and 
    access to structured data from different sources, as a contribution
    towards the implementation of a European Health Data Space initiative.

3.  **establish a federated Virtual Repository Layer**, deployed on a 
    secure distributed data space for FAIR data management and sharing, and 
    to facilitate distributed data search and inform on data quality.

##### Implementation and evaluation

4.  **leverage on novel AI approaches** for achieving multi-lingual NPL to
    allow data extraction and standardization of unstructured data from
    different European centers, and data interpretation and integration
    with structured datasets.
  
5.  **realize an intelligent data navigator** exploiting multimodality,
    virtual assistance, and smart visualization technologies to support
    users in finding data and in fast and accurate assessment of data 
    quality, as well as trust acceptability.

##### European Future Implementation & Achieving Impact

6.  **implement a data governance framework** for distributed data sharing,
    facilitating the negotiation of relevant data sharing agreements, the
    collection of patient consent, the enforcement of accountability, 
    through the application of certification and trust-building methods 
    based on blockchain technology.
       
7.  **implement the realized ecosystem** in pilot EURACAN sites, to assess
    user experience and value creation on the basis of real-world clinical 
    research and public health questions, in different data use and reuse
    cases conducted on top of a "first-in-the-field" technical deployment
    of the IDEA4RC Data Ecosystem.

8.  **investigate and assess translation potential** of pilot experiences
    toward wider stakeholders' audiences, beyond the centers involved in 
    the project consortium, and creating a sustainable "Community of 
    interest" around a continously expanding Data Ecosystem.

9.  **build robust knowledge and information sharing channels** to 
    disseminate scientific and technology results, prepare business planning
    for exploitable components, inform rare cancer patients and health care
    providers of the opportunities created by the project, and inform the
    general public of the effort deployed by IDEA4RC, addressing the
    urgent needs of rare cancer patients, caregivers and families, with the
    key support received from the European Commission.
