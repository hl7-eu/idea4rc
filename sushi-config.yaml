description: IDEA4RC is an EU project aiming at at developing an IT infrastructure to facilitate the sharing and re-use of health data among clinical centers to promote research on rare cancers and improve patients’ access to high quality care. Our challenge is building a new tool to overcome interoperability issues and make it easier to comply with privacy regulations.

# The resources property corresponds to IG.definition.resource.
# SUSHI can auto-generate all of the resource entries based on
# the FSH definitions and/or information in any user-provided
# JSON or XML resource files. If the generated entries are not
# sufficient or complete, however, the author can add entries
# here. If the reference matches a generated entry, it will
# replace the generated entry. If it doesn't match any generated
# entries, it will be added to the generated entries. The format
# follows IG.definition.resource with the following differences:
#   * use IG.definition.resource.reference.reference as the YAML key.
#   * if the key is an id or name, SUSHI will replace it with the
#     correct URL when generating the IG JSON.
#   * specify "omit" to omit a FSH-generated resource from the
#     resource list.
#   * if the exampleCanonical is an id or name, SUSHI will replace
#     it with the correct canonical when generating the IG JSON.
#   * groupingId can be used, but top-level groups syntax may be a
#     better option (see below).
# The following are simple examples to demonstrate what this might
# look like:

  #
# Groups can control certain aspects of the IG generation.  The IG
# documentation recommends that authors use the default groups that
# are provided by the templating framework, but if authors want to
# use their own instead, they can use the mechanism below.  This will
# create IG.definition.grouping entries and associate the individual
# resource entries with the corresponding groupIds. If a resource
# is specified by id or name, SUSHI will replace it with the correct
# URL when generating the IG JSON.
